# Transcode Gallery
## Experimental AR Body Gallery
## 2021 - Chelsea Thompto

**This project is in very early stages and is a work in progress.**

Using [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) to track a tattoo on my arm and apply artwork over top as a performative and site specific yet web-based installation. 

A continuation of the ideas started in my work [A Transmaterial Body](https://www.chelseathompto.com/transmaterial) and featuring a tattoo design based off a codification system I created as part of my project [Transcode 2015](https://www.chelseathompto.com/advancement-to-candidacy).
