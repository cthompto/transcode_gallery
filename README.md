## Overview

Using [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org) and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) to track a tattoo on my arm and apply artwork over top as a performative and body/site specific yet web-based installation space. 

A continuation of the ideas started in my work [A Transmaterial Body](https://www.chelseathompto.com/transmaterial) and featuring a tattoo design based off a codification system I created as part of my project [Transcode 2015](https://www.chelseathompto.com/advancement-to-candidacy). 

The first artist to show at Transcode Gallery is [Lorelei d’Andriole](https://loreleid.art/). She is showing a silent video piece. Screenshot below:
